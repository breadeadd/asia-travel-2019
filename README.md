# Photo Gallery - Asia Trip 2019 📸🌏

**Photo Gallery** is a responsive, horizontal photo grid website I created for my NCEA Level 1 project. It serves as a digital diary recounting my 2019 Asia trip, split into three countries with photo entries organized by days. The gallery features quick-jump buttons for easy navigation between sections, making the site user-friendly and dynamic.

This website was designed and built entirely by myself, focusing on responsive web design and creating an interactive, organized photo album. While the functionality of the site is complete, please note that the images are missing in the current repo version.

## Project Layout 🗂️

The website is structured as follows:

1. **Home Page:** Introductory section to introduce the photo album and Asia trip.
2. **Country Pages:** Each country, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore has its own section with images organised by day of the trip, with brief descriptions.
3. **Quick-Jump Buttons:** Buttons on each page to jump directly to different days or countries, making navigation faster and more intuitive.
